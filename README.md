## Pangolin Rails app

This app uses Ruby 2.5.1 and Rails 5.2.4.1.

## How to use this fancy app

Clone the repo and then install the required gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails t
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails s
```

Then use curl or a browser to search in exactly the way as prescribed in the spec, at localhost:9292.
